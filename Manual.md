# README.md for Your Bioinformatics Pipeline

---

## Overview
This pipeline is designed for the extraction, analysis, and conversion of miRNA precursor sequences and structures in a bioinformatics context. Leveraging the Snakemake workflow management system, it automates the process of 
sequence extraction, structure prediction, and data formatting, facilitating efficient and reproducible analyses.

---

## Files and Structure
- **Snakefile**: Defines the workflow rules and dependencies.
- **convert_to_tsv.py**: Converts data into TSV format.
- **extract_precursors.py**: Extracts miRNA precursor sequences.
- **extract_precursors.yaml**: Conda environment for `extract_precursors.py`.
- **predict_structure.yaml**: Conda environment for RNA structure prediction.

---

## Dependencies
